# 🔁 Palindrome Checker

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that checks whether a given word or sentence is a **palindrome**—meaning it reads the same backward as forward.

## 💡 What It Does

- Takes input from the user
- Ignores leading/trailing spaces and capitalization
- Reverses the string and compares it with the original
- Outputs whether it's a palindrome

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
python palindrome_checker.py
